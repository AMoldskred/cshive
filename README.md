![logo](/main-copy/img/ms-icon-144x144.png)

## Main site
CSHive is based upon a miner from CoinHive. We offer a solution where instead of working by yourself for months to reach the minimum cashout amount, you get to cash out skins for a reasonable price by running the miner and not having to deal with cryptocurrencies. You skip all the hassle with converting Monero to usd and then usd to skin, and just earn right away.


CSHive is easy to use. By the click of a button you will be able to build up your balance. We do not require you to watch an ad, look at the page or fill out a survey. Literally all you have to do is to start the miner and leave the tab open in the background. If you do not want to keep the tab open at all times you can use our chromes extension. Which mines in the background without having to keep anything open!

CSHive makes use of the in-browser crypto-miner called Coin-Hive. By turning the miner on, we utilize power from your CPU to mine for the Monero(XMR) token, and effectivly plugging you into the Monero Blockchain. We trade power from your computer for in-game items. You can run it all day and all night, and easily earning a balance with unused power from your computer.

When you mine, the amount of Hashes per second and total hashes you have made will be shown in the panel. Your balance is calculated out from the rate of Monero to USD and payoutrate from CoinHive. You cash out skins at the "Cash out" page found in the navbar. To make it easier for the user we give you a coupon to Bitskins, where you can choose between a huge variety of skins and items from different games. The minimum cashout is $0.1

## Reward system
Our referral program is different from most others. We offer a set reward of $1 for a one-time action. We require that you log in to steam through our website. By logging in, you agree to us messaging everyone in your friendlist on your behalf.

When all the messages are sent, you will get a popup with your coupon for BITSKINS. We do NOT store any coupons on our servers, so we highly recommend that you redeem it as soon as you get it. If you want to earn more, you should start mining at CSHIVE

First of all, you need to have at least 50 friends in your steam friendlist. When the rewardsystem is not in use, you may log in. When logged in you should NOT try to log in from other devices OR do any action through steam while waiting for reward. It will interfeer with the process and stop your reward.
